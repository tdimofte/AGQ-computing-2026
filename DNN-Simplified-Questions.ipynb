    "This notebook consists of 4 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1 - NumPY DNN\n",
    "\n",
    "This part will walk through with an example constructing a DNN(MLP) using numpy from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will demonstrate how the forward and back propagation work for a simple training of a controlled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2 - PyTorch DNN\n",
    "\n",
    "This part will demonstrate repeating the process of building an MLP using the PyTorch API to repeat the same work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully this demonstrates the advantage of working with frameworks which do the heavy lifting of generating the back-propagation for us from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3 - PyTorch Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "This part will demonstrate constructing a Classifier model to classify data from the mnist numerical dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also use an independent data sub-set to estimate the model accuracy after training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 4 - Projecting beyond the Training Window (Bonus)\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the notebook is a bonus part if you've been able to finish all of the work above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is set out to answer the question. What happens when we project beyond our training window with our Sinusoid model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marking\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get marks for completing the different tasks within this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "Any code expected for you to complete will contain `## FINISH_ME ##` indicating the code isn't expected to run until you have completed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would recommend tackling the playbook in order from Part1 -> Part2 -> Part3 -> Part4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parts 5-9 are due for hand-in on your GitHubs (instructions to follow) by 9:30am on Friday, 30 January, together with a few problems from Week 2.\n",
